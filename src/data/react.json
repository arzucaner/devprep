    "question": "Explain the Virtual DOM in React.",
    "hint": "Think about performance optimization and DOM manipulation.",
    "answer": "The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to improve performance by comparing the Virtual DOM with the real DOM and only updating what's necessary. This process is called reconciliation."

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?",
    "hint": "Consider form handling and state management.",
    "answer": "Controlled components have their form data handled by React state, while uncontrolled components let the DOM handle the form data internally. Controlled components provide more control and validation, while uncontrolled components can be simpler for basic use cases."
