    "question": "Explain the concept of Bridge in React Native.",
    "hint": "Think about communication between JavaScript and native code.",

    "question": "What are the main differences between iOS and Android development in React Native?",
    "hint": "Consider platform-specific APIs and styling.",
    "answer": "Key differences include platform-specific APIs (like PushNotificationIOS vs Android notifications), different styling behaviors (especially with shadows and elevation), and platform-specific components. React Native provides Platform.select() and platform-specific file extensions (.ios.js, .android.js) to handle these differences."
