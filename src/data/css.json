    "question": "Explain the difference between display: flex and display: grid.",
    "hint": "Think about layout dimensions and use cases.",
    "answer": "Flexbox is one-dimensional (row or column) and is great for dynamic content and single-axis layouts. Grid is two-dimensional (rows and columns) and is better for complex layouts with both axes. Flexbox is more suitable for component-level layouts, while Grid is better for page-level layouts."
