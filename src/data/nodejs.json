    "question": "What is the Event Loop in Node.js?",
    "hint": "Consider asynchronous operations and non-blocking I/O.",

    "question": "Explain the difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate().",
    "hint": "Think about the order of execution in the event loop.",
    "answer": "process.nextTick() executes before the next iteration of the event loop, while setImmediate() executes at the end of the current event loop iteration. process.nextTick() has higher priority and can potentially starve the event loop if used improperly."
